# JavaBank

This project was created by Linus Palm (https://github.com/LinusLinusDev) as part of the course "Object-oriented software development" at the FH Aachen.

To run the application, the command "compiler:compile" must be executed once via Maven. After that the application can be started with "javafx:run".
